- 👋 Hi, I’m Sonia@IAmMCCool and I always need help!  I am a total newbie, with close to zero experience. I'm trying to learn as I go, but It's very frustrating. I have so many great ideas, but I'm clueless as to how to make them happen on my website!
- 👀 I’m interested in learning as much as I possibly can that will help me with specific design plans I have in mind and how to implement them on my own social media website.
- 🌱 I’m currently so discouraged I've thought about just giving up.  It's taking forever to learn everything I need to know about how to make things work, and I can't afford to pay anyone or go to school. 
- 💞️ I’m looking for all the help I can get!  I wish I could find someone to partner 50/50 with me.  I have so many great ideas that could blow up bigger than facebook!
- 📫 If you are interested you can message me on here I hope?
